1. What are the must-have pages or sections for your new site? (e.g., Home, About, Services, Packages, Testimonials, Contact)
2. Do you want to keep the same content and structure as your current site, or are there any changes or new features you want to add?
3. Do you have a preferred color scheme, logo, or branding guidelines?
4. Should the site include a blog, booking form, or any interactive features?
